# Module 9 Challenge README

## Student Information
- Student Name: Kevin Ngala
- Training Institution: George Washington University Analytics Bootcamp

## Background

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, Kevin Ngala from George Washington University Analytics Bootcamp tackled the Module 9 Challenge. Utilizing combined learning tools such as PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, as well as Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT, Kevin successfully completed the project. 

## Objective

The objective of this challenge was to design SQL database tables to hold data from CSV files, import data from the CSV files into those tables, and then answer questions about the data: data modeling, engineering, and analysis by using Structured Query Language (SQL). Applying knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, and creating entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).

## Instructions

This Challenge encompasses data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling

Inspect CSV files and design table schemas or create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for all tables.

## Data Engineering

Create table schemas for each CSV file ensuring correct data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Import data into corresponding SQL tables.

## HINT: Import data in the same order as table creation, accounting for headers.

## Data Analysis

1. Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
2. First name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
3. Manager of each department with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. Department number for each employee with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. First name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last name starting with letter B.
6. Employees in the Sales department with employee number, last name, and first name.
7. Employees in Sales and Development departments with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. Frequency counts of employee last names in descending order.
